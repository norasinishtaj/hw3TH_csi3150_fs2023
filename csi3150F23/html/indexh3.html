            <h2>Welcome to Thailand</h2>
            <p>
              Thailand is known the world over as the Land of Smiles, and that
              doesn’t just refer to the tourists. Fashions and trends come and
              go, but one thing Thai people always seem to be wearing is a smile
              – and here, it’ll never go out of fashion. From a cashier at
              7-Eleven to the old ladies you’ll meet on the street, smiles are
              everywhere, and can have a huge impact on your day. Thailand is
              world-famous for its mouthwatering cuisine and for good reason.
              Thai food regularly tops polls for the ‘world’s favorite food’. So
              just what is it that makes Thai food special? It is the
              combination in each dish of the four basic flavors – sweet, sour,
              salty and spicy. Over the centuries, Thai cooking has borrowed
              freely from the culinary arts of China, India and Malaya, blending
              these different influences to create something that is truly
              unique. Thai food has a reputation for being spicy, and for good
              reason. Make sure to try a real Thai food from a street food
              stall! How long should you spend in the country? In most cases,
              you can enjoy a short visit to Thailand in just 5-10 days. If
              you’re looking for a more in-depth cultural experience, we suggest
              spending 10 - 20 days in Thailand. If you have an infinite amount
              of time, you could easily spend at least six weeks in Thailand and
              enjoy the country at a gentle pace.
            </p>

            <h2>Why Thailand</h2>
            <p>
              Thailand can accommodate a range of travel styles. If you’re
              looking to explore South East Asia but don’t know where to start,
              Thailand is the clear winner. The country is an incredibly popular
              destination for first-time travelers. From sacred temples to
              idyllic beaches and activities such as whitewater rafting or
              zip-lining, the diverse terrain of Thailand can accommodate to
              everyone. What’s more, Thailand is very inexpensive; which only
              adds to the attraction. While a trip to Thailand is a must-do for
              almost every traveler, even the most seasoned globetrotter will
              find the kingdom exciting. It is packed with unique, local
              experiences for you to discover.
